First line added in original file

This is the second line (updated one)
I want to push these changes into a sub-branch in Git-hub.

This is the third line (sencond update)
This I've updated in testbranch in Git and want to save it in testbranch of GitHub

This is the fourth line (third update)
Now I'll see if I merge this branch again with master, will it push the changes to testbranch on GitHub?
